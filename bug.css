The following CSS code snippet exhibits unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  height: 50%;
  background-color: lightblue;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.inner {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
```

The expected outcome is that the inner `div` completely fills its parent container.  However, due to rounding issues with percentages and the flexbox layout, a small gap might appear at the bottom or right edge of the inner `div`. This happens because the sum of width or height (50% + 50%) might be slightly smaller than the available space.
